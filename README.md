# Warrior.js Solutions

These are my solutions for [warrior.js](https://github.com/olistic/warriorjs), a javascript AI game. 

Each commit is my solution for that tower (`beginner`|`intermediate`) and level, so jump backwards in history to see my solutions as I go along. 

These are by no way optimal, probably.

Needless to say, this will contain spoilers for the game!
